# Dot Files & DWM
In this repository you will find an aggregation of a range of different configuration files that, together, form a comfortable experience that is beautiful - yet functional. Personally, I made use of the default DWM status bar with the split status patch applied; I also applied a few minor patches that I personally wrote such as the ability to disable the 'occupied' indicators for tags that appear when a tile occupies the tag.

I couldn't quite get dwmblocks to work with autostart which I found to be a game changer and so I wrote a simple bash script with the same name that performs a similar visual function - it unfortunately doesn't feature clickable blocks. In this script, there are a few other scripts linked that serve block-specific data such as the time, memory usage, or battery percentage.
